# PRODIGY_DS_02
This is my first project (Task 2) from my internship at Prodigy InfoTech , where I dived into the exciting realm of Machine Learning. Here's a breakdown of what accomplished. 

Title:Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

I gathered datasets from Kaggle.This process laid the foundation for subsequent analysis. I split the dataset into training and testing subsets and proceeded to train a Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Model. The initial model demonstrated strong performance, achieving an accuracy on the test set.
